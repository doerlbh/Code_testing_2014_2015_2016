5. From this assignment I gained a much better understanding on implicit graphs and its applications in state solution searching. Because the graphs are abstract concepts, in class I felt kind of lost and confused when discussing about each vertex as a state in a problem space. But in implementation, I have a more solid feel of the graph searching algorithm. 

I think implementing BFS is relatively straightforward comparing with IDFS, since in BFS has a relatively slower but exhaustive approach, while IDFS needs to make certain decision before extending. This was more cleared when I tried to implement it. I think another challenge in this assignment is to assign different functions and fields in all four classes defined within this java project. The implementation of equal() and toString() in Vertex gave me a better conceptual understanding for hierarchy structure of classes. The operator at first confuses me, but later I relate it to ResponseItem in A3 and A4, and I started to get the main concept. 

I observed the combinatorial explosion when I tried to increased the number of pegs, and this helps me review the run time estimation. I feel worthwhile and rewarding after this assignment as I can totally correlate it with the wide applications of graphs discussed in class and section.

6. N/A, turned in on time.
